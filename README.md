## Ruby exercises for the 2nd week of the coding bootcamp.

> What does the following error message tell you? Write the answer into a README file
>
>> SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
>>   from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

The error above indicates a common typo mistake, it as been typed a closing parenthesis ')'
instead of a closing curly bracket '}' in the 'Interactive Ruby Shell', at the 2nd line.
